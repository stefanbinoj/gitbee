# Contributing to GitBee

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to GitBee. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [GitBee Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for GitBee. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the steps to reproduce the problem** in as much detail as possible.
- **Provide specific examples** to demonstrate the steps.

### Pull Requests

1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4.  Ensure the test suite passes.
5.  Make sure your code lints.

### Communication Guidelines

**Strictly Enforced: Professional English**  
We maintain a high standard of communication. All issues, PR descriptions, comments, and discussions must be in professional English. Avoid slang, abbreviations (e.g., "u" instead of "you"), and excessive emoji usage unless it adds value. Contributions or comments that do not meet this standard may be hidden or rejected.

### assigning Issues

**We do NOT assign issues to users.**

If you find an issue you would like to work on:

1.  Check the comments to see if someone else is already actively working on it.
2.  If no one is working on it, leave a comment stating that you are starting work on it.
3.  **Start working immediately.**
4.  Do not ask "Can I be assigned to this?". Such comments will likely be ignored. The goal is to encourage proactive contributions.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Thank you for contributing!
